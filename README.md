# MechaCar_Analysis
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The dataset provides 3 non random amounts of variance: vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle and AWD. Furthermore, the maximun random variance was provided by ground_clearence and vehicle_lenght.

We have a p-value that is less than zero, this means the slope is not equal to 0

The R squared value is 71.49%, this would imply that roughly 72% of the time the predcitions will be accurate if we use the linear model

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The current data meets the PSI requirement for Lot 1 and Lot 2 but exceeds the limit for Lot 3 by roughly 70 PSI. However, as a whole, when added together, they are below the required PSI of 100.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

We can test the fuel efficiency of ther MechaCar against the competition to see if the MPG (miles per gallon) are substantially less, to appeal to buyers. The data needed would be the average of miles the MechaCar drrives per gallon, also, the average speed it travels.
