## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The dataset provides 3 non random amounts of variance: vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle and AWD. Furthermore, the maximun random variance was provided by ground_clearence and vehicle_lenght.



We have a p-value that is less than zero, this means the slope is not equal to 0

The R squared value is 71.49%, this would imply that roughly 72% of the time the predcitions will be accurate if we use the linear model
